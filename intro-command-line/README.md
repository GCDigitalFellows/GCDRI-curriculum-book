# Introduction to the Command Line

The command line is a powerful way to interact with your computer, but it can seem intimidating if you haven't used text-based interfaces before. Luckily, you can use 90% of the functionality of the command line by becoming comfortable with a very small set of the most common commands.

In this session, we'll learn those common commands by exploring and manipulating a simple data set. By the end of the session, you'll be able to navigate your computer, create and manipulate files, and transform text-based data using only the command line.
