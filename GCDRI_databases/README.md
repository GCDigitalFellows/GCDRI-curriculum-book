# Databases

A database is a collection of data that is structured to allow for manipulation. This session will introduce one type of database, the relational database, using SQLite, a portable implementation often used in mobile phones and distributed systems. After completing this session, attendees will be able to create tables and insert, read, and delete data in an SQLite database using SQLiteStudio. Attendees will also learn to query a database using SQL statements executed in a Python script.
